# build

## Java

### Use Maven/Gradle Wrapper

By using [Maven Wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper) or [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html)
the build process is encapsulated and provided by the project.

There is no need to have Maven or Gradle installed on your machine or on the build server.
The right version of the build tool will be downloaded as Java JAR artefact.
